"Mariathasan2018_PDL1_treatment","Processed RNA-seq data, quantified as counts and TPM, for bladder cancer samples pre anti-PDL1 immunotherapy. Information on patient's tumor mutational burden and response to anti-PD1 treatment is also provided. Represented as a SummarizedExperiment; derived from IMvigor210CoreBiologies R package (Mariathasan et al., Nature, 2018) under the CC-BY license.","3.13",NA,"tar.gz","http://research-pub.gene.com/IMvigor210CoreBiologies/","Feb 14 2018","Homo sapiens","9606",NA,"Mariathasan S, Turley S, Nickles D et al., â€œTGF-b attenuates tumor response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells.","Federico Marini <marinif@uni-mainz.de>","SummarizedExperiment","Rda","easier/Mariathasan2018_PDL1_treatment.Rda"
"RMTLR_TCGA_cancer_spec_trained_models","Cancer-specifc model parameters learned during training for different quantitative descriptors using Regularized Multi-Task Linear Regression (RMTLR) algorithm with randomized cross-validation repeated 100 times. A total of 100 models are available for each task, here 10 tasks were used. Also, information on training set statistics (i.e. meand and standard deviation) are also provided for normalizing the test set accordingly. Represented as a list object with both cancer-specific models and statistics about the training dataset.","3.13",NA,"tar.gz",NA,NA,"Homo sapiens","9606",NA,NA,"Federico Marini <marinif@uni-mainz.de>","list","Rda","easier/RMTLR_TCGA_cancer_spec_trained_models.Rda"

"Intercellular_network","Cancer-specific intercellular networks based on literature supported pairs in the Ramilowski database (Ramilowski et al., Nat.Commun., 2015), filtering for 24 cell types acknowledged to be present in the TME. Additionally, a pan-cancer cell type is included using data from the CCLE (Barretina et al., Nature, 2012) by computing the median expression of each gene across cell lines related to the selected cancer types.
