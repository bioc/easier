)
}
\arguments{
\item{view_name}{input view name}

\item{view_info}{input view information of its composition.}

\item{view_data}{input view data as a list. Each item of the list correponds to a certain view.}

}
\value{
A matrix with the predictions obtained by applying the model on the view input data
}
\description{
\code{predict_with_multitaskelasticnet} predicts immune response using multi-task elastic net algorithm.
This algorithm employs model parameters learned during training on different types of data in
order to compute the immune response.
